## Fumili minimizer examples

This repo contains (so far) two basic examples of SGZ function implementation for using Fumili minimizer properly:
* one for classical Fumili implementation (ROOT-independet stand-alone version);
* and one is for Fumili with constraints modilication (which is not supported by ROOT at the moment).

About Fumili and Fumili with constraints see [S.N.Dymov, V.S.Kurbatov, I.N.Silin, S.V.Yaschenko, CONSTRAINED MINIMIZATION IN C++ ENVIRONMENT.// Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A, V. 440 (2000), pp. 431-437](https://www2.pv.infn.it/~fontana/download/lect/Dymov_Fumili.pdf)
