##Fumili minimizer examples

This repo contains (so far) two basic examples of SGZ function implementation for using Fumili minimizer properly:
* one for classical Fumili implementation (ROOT-independet stand-alone version);
* and one is for Fumili with constraints modilication (which is not supported by ROOT at the moment).
